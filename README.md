# Calculating global-mean annual-mean near surface temperature

* for SROCC report
* based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 data for all available scenarios
* one ensemble member per model
* relative to 1986, 2005
* using the cmipX-ng (new generation) harmonized archives, see https://data.iac.ethz.ch/atmos/

* note: due to data availability warming is calculated for 2080 to 2099 (instead of 2080 to 2100)
